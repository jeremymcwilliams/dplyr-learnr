### For use with Lewis & Clark's RStudio Server

* Visit <a href='https://datasci.watzek.cloud' target='_blank'>https://datasci.watzek.cloud</a>
* Sign in with your Lewis & Clark username and password. If you haven't created an account yet, you'll be prompted to create a password.
* Once signed in, click "RStudio Server", after which you will need to sign in again (LC username / password you just created)

in console (lower left-hand corner):
* `library(usethis)`
* `use_course("https://github.com/jeremymcwilliams/dplyr-learnr/archive/refs/tags/1.0.zip")`

After running the command above, you'll be prompted whether to download to your current directory. Go ahead and answer in the affirmative (you'll be presented with variations on "yes"). Once the course files download, you'll be prompted as to whether to delete the zip file. Again, answer in the affirmative. Once you do, click "Save", and your window will refresh to a new R session.

In RStudio Server, click the dplyr-learnr.Rmd document. When it opens in the upper left window, click the button to Run the document. This will open the tutorial in a new window.
